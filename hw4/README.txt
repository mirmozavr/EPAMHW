1) Install Python 3.8 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Open command line or PyCharm terminal (optional)
3) Run file directly (python example.py). If all tests work, there will be no output.
4) Use additional -v (python example.py -v) to print a detailed log of what itâ€™s trying, and print a summary at the end.
