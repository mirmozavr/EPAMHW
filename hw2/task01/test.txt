and who also disapproves of Bertie's portrait, due to its hungry look.
Jeeves informs Bertie that Gwladys was in a car accident; she ran over a gentleman's leg.
 The man, Lucius Pim, is now in Bertie's spare bedroom, by Gwladys's request.
 A doctor stated that Pim should not be moved. Bertie speaks to Pim, who mentions
 that his sister, the wife of Slingsby of Slingsby's Superb Soups, is coming tomorrow,
 and will prosecute Gwladys if she finds out that Gwladys injured him. To protect her,

 was Bertie who ran him over. Now that Mrs. Slingsby is angry with Bertie, Ixq; ANj
 Pim suggests that Bertie send her flowers. Bertie reluctantly sends Mrs. Slingsby roses.
